# Spatial Ecology: Modeling Territorial Resource Competition

This repository contains the implementation and analysis of a spatially explicit model of territorial resource competition, inspired by the study “Spatial Ecology of Territorial Populations” (Weiner et al., 2019). The project explores how spatial structure, nutrient diffusion, and metabolic trade-offs influence biodiversity, population dynamics, and ecosystem stability. Features include:
	•	Numerical simulations of nutrient and population dynamics.
	•	Tools for analyzing biodiversity metrics and steady-state properties.
	•	Extensions to incorporate stochastic dynamics and higher-dimensional systems.

Ideal for researchers and enthusiasts in ecological modeling, complex systems, and biophysics.
